Blossom
=======

Blossom is an idea for an HTML5 game by Erika and Naomi Durbin. Erika asked what animal can fly, swim underwater, and be on land. She wasn't satisfied with "duck" as an answer and drew a character she called "Blossom." Blossom's species is unknown and not yet named ("batafish" was rejected).

Here's what we have to go on so far in terms of implementing the game:

> "In the game, Blossom starts out in the sky. If she hits a cloud, she falls into the ocean. If she hits some seaweed while she’s swimming in the ocean, she gets squirted onto the land. If she hits a rock or a boulder on land, then it’s game over. It’s like Flappy Bird, but you get three chances."

We plan to use our previous game [Pastries](https://github.com/pdurbin/pastries) as a starting point. [Uncle Bryce][] is already helping us imagine what Blossom might look like in the game:
